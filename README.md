# ML-Projects
Here you can see my path as Data Scientist, especially in my education. There are projects from ML, Econometrics and BDPT courses. Also, Dec,2022, I was working at Byte Data Hackhaton. It was my first deep diving in NLP, which I prefer to teach more, in case of interesting task in this area of DS.
