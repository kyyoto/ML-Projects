# ML-Projects
My last project - BERT Fine Tuning and Pre-Training. Write now I`m working on Llama Fine Tuning using russian corpus of text.
Here you can see my path as Data Scientist, especially in my education. There are projects from ML, Econometrics and BDPT courses. Also, Dec,2022, I was working at Byte Data Hackhaton. It was my first deep diving in NLP, which I prefer to teach more, in case of interesting task in this area of DS.
